## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to work with asynchronous generators and async comprehensions in Python. These are powerful features for writing concurrent and efficient code in asynchronous applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Write asynchronous generators in Python.
2. Utilize async comprehensions to work with asynchronous tasks.
3. Properly type-annotate generators, functions, and coroutines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Pycodestyle 2.5.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-python-project.git
